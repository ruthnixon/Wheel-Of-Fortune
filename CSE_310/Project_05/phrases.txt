Break a leg
Dig in
Bite your tongue
Butt out
By the skin of my teeth
Beats me
Drop me a line
Get off my tail
As we speak
Be that as it may
You cant fight the city hall
Cut the comedy
Dont even go there
Dont I know it
Do you get my drift
Fill in the blanks
Gotcha
Hang in there
Have a heart
Hold your horses

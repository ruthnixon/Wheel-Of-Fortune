# Rute Berehe
# Overview

This project was meant to give me a challenge with Python, a language I am already familiar with. It allowed me to explore things I haven't used as much, such as reading and writing form files, classes and some data structures.

# Description of the software 

My program plays a game like Wheel of Fortune. The game allows two players to guess letters in a phrase taking turns. The phrases are red in from a file and then randomly chosen. Then after all the correct letters are guessed, the game displays the winner and writes the scores into another file.

# Purpose of this software 

The purpose of this software was for me to challenge myself with a project that explored things I wasn't as familiar with. I really like programming in Python and it was fun learning how to do more things with it.

# Development Environment

I wrote the software in Python 3.9.7. In this program I used the built in functions for reading and writing files, the set and list datastructures and my own class to represent the players.

# Useful Websites

* [W3 Schools Python tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

* I would like to be able to calculate the score based on how many letters there are of the one the user guessed.
* I would like to add more rounds like in the game show. 
* I would like to allow more players at a time.
